I am a Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/) advised by Prof. [Jimeng Sun](https://www.sunlab.org/). I am also working closely with Prof. [Jiawei Han](https://hanj.cs.illinois.edu), Prof. [Sheng Wang](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~swang/), Dr. [Lijun Wu](https://apeterswu.github.io/), Dr. [Kun Qian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kun-qian-7537611aa/) and [Tian Wang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tianwng/). Before that, I earned my B.Eng and MS degree in Automation at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/).

My research focuses on **foundation models** (e.g., large language models (LLMs), multi-modal models), **reinforcement learning** (RL), and **agents**, with their applications in healthcare, biomedicine, and recommendation systems. I am particularly interested in how these models can be used for reasoning, retrieval, and decision-making in complex, real-world scenarios.
- **LLM-centric Research**: Search Agents ([DeepRetrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.00223), [s3](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.14146)), Knowledge Graphs ([GenRES](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.10744)), LLM Efficiency ([Cascade Speculative Drafting](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/file/9cb5b083ba4f5ca6bd05dd307a2fb354-Paper-Conference.pdf)), Revisiting SFT Forgetting ([TALR](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20758?))
- **LLMs/RL + Healthcare**: EHR Reasoning Model with RL ([EHRMind](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24105)), Clinical Trial Foundation Model ([Panacea](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11007), [TrialPanorama](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.16097))
- **BioMedical Foundation Models**: Molecule Foundation Model ([Pisces](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.21.517439v2.full.pdf), [R<sup>2</sup>-DDI](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/24/1/bbac576/6961471)), Single-cell Foundation Model ([EpiAgent](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2024/12/21/2024.12.19.629312.full.pdf))
- **LLMs/RL + Recommendation**: Bridge RecSys with LLMs using RL ([Rec-R1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.24289))


_I am currently seeking research-oriented internship opportunities for the summer of 2026. Please contact me if you have any recruitment openings._
